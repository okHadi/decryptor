Decryptor (patent and trademark pending) is a free program
made for users so that they can invest into crypto more wisely.

The purpose is to save the people from "crypto gurus", and to create
more trust and transparency between the common man and the big guns
of the crypto industry so that more people invest in crypto without
being scammed.

PLease note that investment is a risky process and we are not any financial advisors.
DO it on your own risk. This is just here to help.
